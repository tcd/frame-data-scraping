"EX Rekkas are Yang's best feature, with great stun, damage, corner carry, and okizeme.
									In just about every way that a special move could be considered good, Yang's EX
									Tourou Zan is good. They combo from lights, they have great range and thus combo
									consistency, they can be used after most grounded parries, they are a nice chip KO
									tool, they can be spaced to be relatively safe, and they even extend a few of Yang's
									juggles in corners. The only down sides is that it doesn't do too much against
									aerial opponents, it costs meter, and while it can be spaced to be safe it is still
									punishable on block by things like Ken SA3 or Chun Li SA2. This means that you want
									to confirm your EX slashes whenever you can so you don't waste meter and potentially
									get smacked. Yang can very easily go into EX Rekkas from most of his most common
									okizeme options, like cr. LK -> cr.LK, close MP -> LK, and Zenpou Tenshin, and since
									they give you okizeme to work with he can just as easily set up for another one.
									This gives Yang a remarkable ability to keep momentum going. All you need is a few
									EX slashes in a row to stun the opponent and eat off chunks of their life. This move
									alone affects Yang's super art choice so much that most Yang players pick SA2 purely
									because it stocks the most opportunities for EX Rekkas."
