"Urien jabs into the air quickly, primary uses include comboing into s.MP, a quick,

"Urien stretches with his right hand very far for a nice punch, solid poke, very good

								(mostly rushing attacks). If used as anti-air, can be canceled into a tackle, headbutt
								or anti-air fireball to mess up would be air-parries. Combos into headbutts and tackles
								from close range. Good all around move. Best move for wiffing to gain meter."	Far Strong	MP	80(14 life points)	9	No	Yes	Yes	5	5	10	0	+1	+2	HL	H	2	6	11	4	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-

"Urien lifts his leg torwards the sky and swings it down like an axe. Slow overhead, makes

								knocks down in air. Not a good every day move but it's nice to throw out every once in a
								while. Unsafe on block, can be reversaled by certain moves (Shippu for example)"	Roundhouse	HK	140(50+90)(16 life points)	12(3+9)	No	No	No	17	3	20	-7	-5	-3	HL	H	3	10	19	4	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-

"An 8-hit neutral throw. When you perform this throw, drum your fingers across all 3

"This move is quite good for an anti-air as the reach is far, however, try to use it at
