"The almighty foot. You can land this as part of Remy's LP xx LK target combo, but the timing for this is difficult.

"In 3S, meeting the opponent air-to-air is normally a safer option than grounded anti-airs since most air normals don't allow combos on airborne opponents. This blunt elbow strike is an exception to this and makes Remy's opponents want to parry way earlier in their jump arc than most other characters, which can open them up for Remy's myriad of other options. Generally you only have time for a flash kick once you land, but if you smack the opponent particularly high in their jump near the corner you can do a short or forward Cold Blue Kick first."

"As far as UOHs go, Remy gets a good amount of use out of spaced/meaty UOH -> SA2, especially with a standing HK kara giving it a massive range boost.

"Because Remy has few ways of dissuading parries, this throw is a godsend.

Not only does Remy have a hard time making them block low, but making them parry low is also difficult.

"This move is the most basic and scary of all of Remy's anti-airs, since it allows juggles on hit. On grounded connects and when midscreen it gives you time to charge up a HK flash kick, which is Remy's max damage for close range parries. In the corner you can combo an short Cold Blue Kick before this for more damage. Be careful to switch up between anti-airs, as if this move is air parried you're eating a fat combo."

"Guile much? While a sweep for most characters is a risky but slightly more rewarding low, the risk-reward for Remy is definitely not in his favor. This is due to the fact that, on block, the two hits are not a true blockstring, allowing the opponent to blue parry the second hit on reaction. Not only that, but on hit you get little okizeme since you're stuck whiffing the second hit. It's not useless, but only pull this out if you are confident that the opponent isn't blocking low."

"While this is an overhead with good range, it has little else going for it - the startup is somewhat reactable (meaning opponents can potentially parry on reaction, depending on skill level) and it's pretty bad on hit/block, ending your turn and potentially opening the door for the opponent to punish you for it.
