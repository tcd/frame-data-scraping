It can even avoid high hitting supers altogether when done early enough.  Its parry bait as well since opponents who know about this move will stick lows/overheads out constantly to punish you for using this.  Its throw invincible though not attack invincible.  It can help you out every once in a while to get out of pressure but its not recommended to do it all the time.	-

The range of this move is deceptive, it can hit very high in the air and even stuff out some of the other shoto's air tatsu's.  Useful for when the opponent tries to jump out of the corner and you smack them back down into there with it.  The EX can hit up to 3 times if you catch an Opp. jumping away or if you're up close (Akuma, Remy, Urien and Hugo).  Like the tackle, you can also combo into this off the basketball taunt, you know, for style.  This move is one that opponents tend to look out for or bait out the most because of how easy it is to parry it, even the EX so be careful.	{"Parry":"H"}

Useful to close distance from you to the opponent when used just for the dash itself.  The tackle itself is meant to be used defensively when you parry an attack with a long recovery from a long distance but it can be used to catch whiffed lows or dashes when in close enough range.  You can cancel into this (LP version) from his any of his close normals for fake outs into grab/EX DS/super but be for-warned doing this against someone who's quick enough to punish you.  You can combo into this off of his taunt for style.  Be warned, the attack is not a grab and the attack doesn't have the "duck" property (like Yun's jump kick and Dudley's rush attack or Sean's Zenten).
