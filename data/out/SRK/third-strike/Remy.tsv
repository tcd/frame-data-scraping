Remy	Light of Virtue (Punch)	TRUE		Super	Any	The traditional Sonic Boom, in a game where you can parry sonic booms. Just like Guile, Remy's Sonic Boom is the best meterless projectile in the game, with lightning fast recovery and great frame advantage. It's so fast that someone could reaction super through your fireballs and you would still have enough time to smack them with a super 2 afterwards. You can set up a meaty Sonic Boom (*ahem* Light of Virtue) very easily after a knockdown for obnoxious kara throw mixups, kara UOH, low Short, pokes, or whatever else you want to subject your opponent to depending on the character. The high version can unfortunately be crouched by most characters (except Q and Hugo, in which matchups this move is incredibly obnoxious).

Remy	Close Roundhouse	TRUE	2	Special,Super	Any	A 2-hit tall kick that allows links to SA2 afterwards. Sounds nice, until you remember that the first hit only comes out point blank, which is a shame because it also special cancels. Still, it can act as a decent anti-air for opponents only expecting one parry.	-	161	Proximity Normal	c.HK		multi hit	140	140(80+60)	23	-	-	16	16(7+9)	6	-	3	-	-	15	-	5	-	3	-	7	-	-	-	3	-	12	-	25	-	8	8(4+4)	{"Parry":"H","Juggle Value":"3/3","Reset or Juggle":"Reset/Reset"}
Remy	Far Roundhouse	TRUE		-	Any	Functions as a slower, beefier version of standing Strong. Good in anti-air scenarios with a high angled hitbox, but prone to air parries. Also OK as a poke against some taller characters like Hugo, but can be crouched.	-	162	Proximity Normal	f.HK		-	130	-	23	-	-	11	-	10	-	3	-	-	23	-	-7	-	-9	-	-5	-	-	-	3	-	10	-	19	-	4	-	{"Parry":"H","Juggle Value":"15","Reset or Juggle":"Reset"}
Remy	Crouch Jab	TRUE		Self,Special,Super	Any	cr.LP -> cr.LP -> flash kick is another one of Remy's confirms, but it's held back somewhat by the fact that cr.LP can be parried in any direction. Still, it IS a confirm. 3 cr.LPs -> flash kick is also a combo that requires no prior charge, but also requires you to be point blank.	-	210	Normal	2LP		-	30	-	3	-	-	3	-	5	-	2	-	-	7	-	2	-	2	-	2	-	-	-	0	-	1	-	2	-	4	-	{"Parry":"HL","Juggle Value":"15","Reset or Juggle":"Reset"}
Remy	Crouch Strong	TRUE		Special,Super	Any	Good range, but low damage. It's usually cancelled into LoV for pressure, but can also be parried in either direction. Not only does Remy have a hard time making them block low, but making them parry low is also difficult. Given that this is Remy's main cancel for extending combos and blockstrings, it's a rather nifty tool. It also has a very good anti-air hitbox, as if Remy didn't have enough of those.	-	220	Normal	2MP		-	55	-	9	-	-	5	-	5	-	5	-	-	11	-	-1	-	-2	-	0	-	-	-	2	-	6	-	11	-	4	-	{"Parry":"HL","Juggle Value":"15","Reset or Juggle":"Reset"}
Remy	Crouch Fierce	TRUE		-	Any	This move is the most basic and scary of all of Remy's anti-airs, since it allows juggles on hit. On grounded connects and when midscreen it gives you time to charge up a HK flash kick, which is Remy's max damage for close range parries. In the corner you can combo an short Cold Blue Kick before this for more damage. Be careful to switch up between anti-airs, as if this move is air parried you're eating a fat combo.	-	230	Normal	2HP		hard knockdown	100	-	17	-	-	9	-	9	-	5	-	-	18	-	N/A	-	-5	-	N/A	-	-	-	3	-	10	-	19	-	4	-	{"Parry":"HL","Juggle Value":"3","Reset or Juggle":"Juggle"}
Remy	Crouch Short	TRUE		Special,Super	Low	Very important, as it's the only way you can safely make the opponent fear a low in neutral, even though it has no confirming options, bad damage, and is 0 on hit/block. More like a nuisance than anything threatening. Still, strings like low Short xx low LoV and low Short xx Light of Justice are safe and make the opponent block their toes to avoid damage, although neither confirm.	-	240	Normal	2LK		-	30	-	5	-	-	3	-	3	-	4	-	-	7	-	0	-	0	-	0	-	-	-	0	-	1	-	2	-	4	-	{"Parry":"L","Juggle Value":"15","Reset or Juggle":"Reset"}
Remy	Crouch Forward	TRUE		-	Low	This would be a nice low poke if not for the fact that it's laughably minus. Most shotos can sweep this on reaction and most other characters can get free damage depending on spacing. Still, it's not worthless against characters with bad mid-range punish options, like Dudley, but it still ends your momentum.	-	250	Normal	2MK		-	60	-	10	-	-	3	-	8	-	5	-	-	18	-	-8	-	-9	-	-7	-	-	-	2	-	6	-	11	-	4	-	{"Parry":"L","Juggle Value":"15","Reset or Juggle":"Reset"}
Remy	Crouch Roundhouse	TRUE	2	-	Low	Guile much? While a sweep for most characters is a risky but slightly more rewarding low, the risk-reward for Remy is definitely not in his favor. This is due to the fact that, on block, the two hits are not a true blockstring, allowing the opponent to blue parry the second hit on reaction. Not only that, but on hit you get little okizeme since you're stuck whiffing the second hit. It's not useless, but only pull this out if you are confident that the opponent isn't blocking low.	-	260	Normal	2HK		hard knockdown, multi hit	210	-	17	-	-	6	3+3	9	-	7	2/5	-	21	-	-	-	-11	-	-	-	-	-	3	-	20	-	22	-	4	-	{"Parry":"L","Juggle Value":"15","Reset or Juggle":"Juggle"}

Remy	Jump Strong	TRUE		-	Overhead	Remy smacks you with his clown fingers with a good amount of active frames. Can be used in air-to-airs or to tick throw, but is generally outclassed by jumping Fierce.	-	320	Normal	j.MP		air only	70	-	12	-	-	11	-	5	-	14	-	-	-	-	-	-3～+10	-	-3～+10	-	=+7～+10	-	-	2	-	6	-	11	-	4	-	{"Parry":"H","Juggle Value":"3","Reset or Juggle":"Reset"}
Remy	Jump Fierce	TRUE		-	Overhead	In 3S, meeting the opponent air-to-air is normally a safer option than grounded anti-airs since most air normals don't allow combos on airborne opponents. This blunt elbow strike is an exception to this and makes Remy's opponents want to parry way earlier in their jump arc than most other characters, which can open them up for Remy's myriad of other options. Generally you only have time for a flash kick once you land, but if you smack the opponent particularly high in their jump near the corner you can do a short or forward Cold Blue Kick first.	-	330	Normal	j.HP		air only	125	-	22	-	-	15	-	9	-	5	-	-	-	-	-	-2～+13	-	-2～+13	-	=+8～+13	-	-	3	-	10	-	19	-	4	-	{"Parry":"H","Juggle Value":"3","Reset or Juggle":"Juggle"}

Remy	Jump Roundhouse	TRUE		-	Overhead	The hitbox goes very low to the ground, making it hit characters looking to anti-air parry earlier than usual. It also hits most characters after an immediate neutral jump, making neutral jumps yet another potential anti-air in Remy's kit. This is your main jump-in normal alongside jumping Fierce.	-	360	Normal	j.HK		air only	120	-	21	-	-	13	-	10	-	4	-	-	-	-	-	-1～+13	-	-1～+13	-	=+7～+13	-	-	3	-	10	-	19	-	4	-	{"Parry":"H","Juggle Value":"3","Reset or Juggle":"Reset"}
Remy	Super Art 1	TRUE	7		Any	This super has 2 main advantages over Super 2. One is that it's completely safe on block with massive pushback, making it a valuable cancel from low Short. The second is that it's an incredibly obnoxious parry as an anti-air or on wake-up, making it good at shutting down characters like Dudley or Hugo who have a hard time without parries in those situations. It's pretty matchup dependent because against most characters Remy would rather take the burst damage and extra meter that Super 2 provides.

Remy	Super Art 2	TRUE	10		Any	This super gives Remy some nice confirming options into big damage like close Forward, close Jab xx close Jab xx close Short, and crouch Jab -> crouch Jab. Unfortunately, in juggles it loses half of its hits for some pitiful damage. It IS fast enough to hit someone out of a JP 15 air reset, meaning you can cancel any normal on air hit into it. It hits on air resets, so close Jab or any air-to-air jumping normal into SA2 is possible, though the opponent could theoretically parry out. It's a one frame parry after the freeze, so that is nightmarishly hard. Besides the super itself, it also gives Remy the most meter out of all his supers, stocking a total of 6 EX moves in the back pocket.

Remy	Super Art 3	TRUE	7		Any	Hilariously bad, Blue Nocturne is by and away the worst super in the entire game. It's a counter super, meaning that the opponent has to hit you after the super freeze to activate. So anytime you activate this outside of confirming it (easier said than done), the opponent could just...you know... not hit it and get a full jump in combo on Remy. The ONLY WAY to get this off in a real match is to parry a multihit attack and then activate, which is incredibly specific. Or you could pick SA2 and do close Forward -> SA2 or raw SA2 after a multihit parry instead.
