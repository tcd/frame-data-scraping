Just like Guile, Remy's Sonic Boom is the best meterless projectile in the game, with lightning fast recovery and great frame advantage. It's so fast that someone could reaction super through your fireballs and you would still have enough time to smack them with a super 2 afterwards. You can set up a meaty Sonic Boom (*ahem* Light of Virtue) very easily after a knockdown for obnoxious kara throw mixups, kara UOH, low Short, pokes, or whatever else you want to subject your opponent to depending on the character. The high version can unfortunately be crouched by most characters (except Q and Hugo, in which matchups this move is incredibly obnoxious). This move also synergizes very well with Remy's great forward dash or a spaced Cold Blue Kick to quickly approach with a Sonic Boom in front.",
